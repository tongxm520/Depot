One of the big surprises and accomplishments is the fact that Unobtrusive Javascript made it
into Rails 3. At first, we thought UJS wasn’t going to be included in Rails 3. Well, just
before the first beta came out, the community responded well and a bunch of enthusiastic
developers finished up one of the most wanted feature in Rails 3.

Let’s see how easy it is to swap jQuery in Rails 3. In the root of a Rails 3 application, run:
curl -L http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js > public/javascripts/jquery.js
curl -L http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/raw/master/src/rails.js > public/javascripts/rails.js

Here’s an initializer I got to know from Yehuda that you can define in config/initializers
so javascript_include_tag :defaults uses jQuery instead of Prototype.

module ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper
  remove_const :JAVASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SOURCES
  JAVASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SOURCES = %w(jquery.js rails.js)
  reset_javascript_include_default
end

With that set, Rails is now unaware of Prototype, all of the helpers with :remote => true
will be grabbed by rails.js and worked through jQuery. You might also want to remove the
Prototype libraries inside public/javascripts if you’re not going to use them.

As you can see, UJS in Rails 3 is pretty easy. Though there is a bit of a configuration
to be done if you’re going against the default option in Rails, it’s far easier to work with
than in the previous versions. You should also look at the fantastic Rails 3 Release Notes
for changes in the concerned helpers and the section on Unobtrusive Javascript in my article
on RailsDispatch.
